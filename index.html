							<p>It was a short period working with this title as it was close to its release when I joined the company.

							I then joined the QA team to help them test all those fixes as there were quite a few tickets.
							After that, I left the Beyond the Wire team to join the SQUAD team, but I'm super happy to have my name in game credits for the first time :)</p>
