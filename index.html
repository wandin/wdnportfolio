								<b>We Defeat Nations</b>
								<p>I am currently working on this game, a true first-person shooter where you can visualize the complete (or almost complete) body of your character, much like in real life. I have been focusing extensively on 3C (Character, Camera, and Controls) so that the character aligns closely with the final vision. It has been challenging working with Unreal Engine's default animations, tweaking and employing blends to achieve the desired outcome.
									We now have the character's movement and rotation (Turn in place) functioning, as showcased in the videos below. Full-body IK has also been implemented, applying IK to the hands and feet of the character.</p>
								<p>I have started working on the game's UI, as evident in the video. Currently, only the Health aspect is programmed, with the next step being the completion of the game's Overlay.</p>
								<p>The entire game is documented on Confluence, and I am utilizing JIRA to manage my project by creating tickets for myself to maintain organization.</p>
